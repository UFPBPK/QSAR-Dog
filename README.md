# QSAR-Dog

# This repository contains the final model file and the data file for the AI-QSAR model to predict plasma half-lives of drugs in dogs.

The model code can be executed using Google Colab. To reproduce or apply this model, users can run each block of the code step by step. The code file contains detailed annotation to help understand the function of each block of the code. The half-life data is named "medDog" and molecular descriptors used for the AI-QSAR model are in the folder named "Descriptors".

The title of the manuscript describing this project is “A machine learning-empowered quantitative structure-activity relationship model for predicting the plasma half-life of drugs in dogs”. This manuscript is under review.
